# Quiz-Game
I have made a quiz game with the help of python. In this game, I have created 4 levels  each level contains 5 questions, and the level increases difficulty increases after each level, you will get to know your score, and how many questions you have got correct, and you will be asked whether you have to continue the game or not after each level. It will be fun playing it.
